Here's my food order history:

{order_history}

Based on my order history, can you suggest:
1. What I might want to order today
2. A new restaurant or food type I might enjoy trying
3. What time I typically order food
4. Any patterns or preferences you notice in my ordering habits

Please be specific in your recommendations and explain your reasoning.

If you notice I order from certain restaurants more frequently, include those in your analysis. For restaurants I order from repeatedly, suggest specific menu items I might enjoy but haven't tried yet.

Consider factors like:
- Time of day when I typically order
- Price ranges I prefer
- Types of cuisine I order most often
- Days of the week I tend to order certain foods
- Balance between trying new items and repeating favorites

Make your recommendations practical and actionable. Suggest specific dishes or restaurants rather than generic food categories.
