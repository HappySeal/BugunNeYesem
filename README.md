## Usage

1. Run the Telegram bot:
   ```
   python food_recommendation_bot.py
   ```
2. Open the bot in Telegram and click "Start"
3. Use the menu buttons to:
   - Update order data (always fetches fresh data from TGO Yemek)
   - View your recent orders
   - Get personalized food recommendations
   - Get advanced AI recommendations from Claude
   - See your top 5 restaurants

## Data Fetching

The bot always fetches fresh data when you click "Update Order Data":

1. **Fresh Data**: The update process:
   - Logs into TGO Yemek using credentials from your `.env` file
   - Fetches your most current order history
   - Saves it as JSON
   - Converts it to CSV for analysis

2. **Manual**: You can also manually fetch data:
   ```
   python login_flow.py
   ```

## Advanced AI Recommendations

The bot offers two types of recommendations:
- **Standard recommendations** based on simple pattern analysis
- **Advanced AI recommendations** powered by Claude AI that provide deeper insights

To use the Claude AI feature:
1. Add your Anthropic API key to the `.env` file
2. Click the "ðŸ¤– AI Recommendation" button in the bot

You can customize the AI recommendations by editing the `claude_prompt_template.txt` file, which contains the instructions sent to Claude AI. This allows you to tailor the AI's analysis to focus on aspects you're most interested in.

## Security

- All credentials (Telegram, TGO Yemek, and Claude API) are stored in the `.env` file
- This file is not tracked by git (listed in .gitignore)
